This is a framework-less and library-less implementation of a Perceptron (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron). This is a Single-Layer Machine Learning
algorithm built for the task of classification.

arq.txt is the training data used for the perceptron.

The perceptron's job is to classify if a given point in a cartesian field is "red" or "blue". Red points have x >= 0, regardless of what y coordinate. Blue points have x < 0, again, regardless of what y coordinate.

The perceptron was written in python 3, and the training data included suffices for whatever points, but you're welcome to change it however you want.
